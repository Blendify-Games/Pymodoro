Ciao,  my   name   is   Pymodoro. Sono un pomodoro... a 
tomato made in python, and I am here... hmmm... como si
dice "aiutarti a lavorare"? Aaaah, help you to work.

You can set your tempo di lavoro, tempo di riposo
and choose to have long pausa or not. The parametri 
are:
    
Work time: 25 minuti di lavoro. You can work for
25 minutes before resting. You can change the time.
    
Break time: 5 minuti di riposo. After your work time
you can rest for 5 minutes before going to work again.
You can also change this time.

Cycles before a long break: if zero there'll be no long
breaks, otherwise you can choose how many 
(work + break) cycles you want before taking a long 
break.

Long break time: if zero there'll be no long breaks,
otherwise you can set here the time of your long break.
