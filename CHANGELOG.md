# Changelog

## Mar 15, 2024 (v1.0.1):

* Fixing initial text in portuguese removing the extra "um" at the beggining of the text.
* Adding a "Back Button" on "Show Pomodoro Scene". By pressing this button the user can go back to change the Pomodoro setup but it loses the current pomodoro status. A simple go back button.
* Updated the screenshots to contemplate the Back Button and text fixing.
